> A machine learning project to predict automobile prices based on various features.

## Description

> This project explores the application of machine learning in predicting automobile prices. We aim to build a predictive model that can estimate the price of a car based on its various attributes such as make, model, engine size, and more. The project encompasses data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Data Source 
> The dataset used in this project is sourced from [[link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/toramky/automobile-dataset)]. It includes information about various automobiles, such as make, model, year, engine specifications, prices, ......

## Technologies

- Python
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- pandas
- NumPy

## Usage

Explore the Jupyter Notebook for step-by-step guidance:

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values, and scaling.
- Model Training: Building and training a Linear Regression model.
- Evaluation: Assessing model performance using MAE and RMSE.
- Visualization: Visualizing results with various plots.

## Results

- Trained machine learning model for car price prediction.
- Performance metrics (MAE and RMSE) on scaled and original data.
- Visualizations showcasing model performance and data insights.

## Future Work
